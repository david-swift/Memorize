### Build Flatpak Locally

You can also build the app yourself, e.g. to modify the source code.

1. Download this repository's source code and open the folder using [GNOME Builder](https://apps.gnome.org/Builder/).
2. Build and run the project using the run button.
3. Next to the hammer icon, in the dropdown menu, select `Export` and wait for the file browser to appear.
4. Open the `.flatpak` file with [GNOME Software](https://apps.gnome.org/Software/) and install the app.

## Usage

Create a new set using the `+` button in the sidebar. Click the pen icon to edit the set's title
and content, or to delete the set.

### Import

![Import Quizlet Set](data/tutorials/Import.png)

If you have a Quizlet set you'd like to use, click the download icon next to `Add Flashcard`.
Follow the tutorial [here](data/tutorials/Import.mp4).

### Study

![Study Set](data/tutorials/Study.png)

The study mode follows a simple principle: each flashcard starts with the same initial difficulty value.
The cards will be presented in a random order. Type in the answer and press enter.
If correct, the difficulty score decreases, otherwise, it increases by one.
Cards with a score of zero won't appear again in this round.
You can restart the study mode at any time.

### Test

![Test Set](data/tutorials/Test.png)

A test is one page containing a specified number of random flashcards.
Type in your answers and scroll down to correct and see your score. Correct your mistakes.

### Export

![Export Set](data/tutorials/Export.png)

In the toolbar of the view for editing a set, find the button with a sharing icon in order to export the set.

## Localization

Translations are welcome! You can either edit the [Localized.yml file](Sources/Model/Localized.yml) directly as YAML,
or install the [Localizer](https://github.com/AparokshaUI/Localizer) app and translate with a UI.

Either way, commit the changes via git and open a pull request.
